  <h2>Personal Developmet</h2>
  <h3>Concept:</h3>
  <p>Personal development covers activities that improve awareness and identity, develop talents and potential, build
    human capitaland facilitate
    employability, enhance the quality of life andcontribute to the realization of dreams and aspirations. Personal
    development takes place over
    the course of a person's entire life. Not limited to self-help, the concept involves formal and informal activities
    for developing others in roles
    such as teacher, guide, counselor, manager, life coach or mentor. When personal development takes place in the
    context of institutions,it refers to
    the methods, programs, tools, techniques, and assessment systems that support human development at the individual

    <h3>Examples of Personal Development Goals for a Better You:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Embrace Empathy.</strong> Empathy is about objectively comprehending differing perspectives which in
        turn provides a wealth of insight into your perspective.</li>
      <li><strong>Confidence.</strong> Studies have revealed that an individual’s IQ is not the most important component
        for success. Instead, the following three factors are considered to be much more important than intelligence in
        determining success: self-confidence, goal setting, and perseverance. An individual’s self-esteem, or your
        self-confidence, is basically what he or she thinks about himself or herself. One of the reasons for boosting
        your self-confidence is that there
        is a strong association between confidence and success. Hence, one of your self-development goals should
        definitely be to boost your self-confidence</li>
      <li><strong>Actively.</strong> Actively learn to pay attention and demonstrate to others that you truly value
        their opinions and what they have too ay. Choose active listening, open-ended questions, with supporting body
        language, and remove any distractions that impede your ability to listen.</li>
      <li><strong>Stop Procrastinating.</strong> You need to understand that procrastination is not a character trait,
        but rather a habit. Since it is a habit, it is 100% possible for you to unlearn it just as you have learnt the
        habit. Strive to utilize time in the most effective manner and avoid procrastination by all means.</li>
      <li><strong>Wake up Early.</strong> Develop the habit to get up early. The age old proverb which says: “Early to
        bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise!” has been coined owing to the multiple benefits of
        an early riser. Some of these include: watching and enjoying the sun rise, do some early morning exercise for
        your fitness, being able to work on a project just because it’s important to you before the day officially gets
        started, and so on. In addition, studies show that early rises are happier, healthier, and more productive than
        their late rising counterparts.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Read More.</strong> Read Often. Nothing is more powerful than the treasure of knowledge and the best
        way to acquire this treasure is to read as much as you can. Research has proved that acquiring new knowledge
        satisfies an individual’s thirst for competence, which makes them eventually happier. You must develop the habit
        of reading books that will help you to acquire new skills and as well as to polish your existing skills.</li>
      <li><strong>Manage Stress Effectively.</strong> Too much stress can land you up in distress. It impacts not you’re
        your physical health but also your mental and emotional health. You must know how to effectively manage stress.
        There are a lot of stress management techniques available these days. So all you need to develop is the
        willingness to fight stress. Finding the means to tackle stress is not a challenge these days with help
        available at the click of a mouse.</li>
